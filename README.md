## Overview
This Student Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage basic student and teacher information, including accounts, subjects, and activities. The system uses HashMaps and Lists to manage data. It allows admin, students, and teachers to interact with various functionalities like logging in, viewing and adding subjects, accessing personal information, and adding fellow teachers. It implements simple authorization mechanisms for students, teachers, and administrators.
